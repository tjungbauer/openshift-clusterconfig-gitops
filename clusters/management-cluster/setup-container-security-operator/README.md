# Overview

This "wrapper" Helm Chart is used to deploy Quay Container Security Operator using a GitOps approach. 
It calls the Chart [setup-container-security-operator](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/openshift-bootstraps/setup-container-security-operator) which takes care to deploy the Operator that does not require any additional configuration.
